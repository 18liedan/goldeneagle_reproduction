### This is my repository with R code for modelling captive golden eagle reproductive success.
- [GEmhc_calc.Rmd](GEmhc_calc.Rmd) is the markdown file used to (1) calculate the % difference of MHC alleles found in the male and female of a pair and (2) construct a matrix of amino acid distances for all possible combinations of alleles.
- [GEbreedingsuccess.Rmd](GEbreedingsuccess.Rmd) is the markdown file used to run the generalized linear mixed models.
